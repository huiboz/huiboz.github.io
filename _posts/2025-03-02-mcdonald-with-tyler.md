## I Ate McDonald’s with Tyler – A Nostalgic Reminder of Parenting

Hello, World! This is my first personal blog. I suddenly felt the urge to start jotting down diary entries as my 30th birthday approaches.

I met Tyler through our apartment community, and we quickly became good friends. He has two lovely dogs, Major and Fendi.

Today, I suggested having dinner at McDonald’s. Tyler wasn’t too excited about the idea — having grown up in the U.S., he had eaten way too much of it as a kid. He joked that he had definitely eaten more McDonald’s than I ever had.

Still, he came along, and on our way there, we talked about why I love McDonald’s so much. I told him that when I was a kid, Western fast food was still relatively new in China. My mom would take me to McDonald’s as a reward for getting good grades in school. That’s probably why I still have such a fondness for it.

That conversation made me realize just how hard parenting is. My mom spent so much time preparing home-cooked meals for me, yet McDonald’s still seemed more appealing. I took her love and effort for granted.

Fun fact: Although KFC isn’t as popular as McDonald’s globally, it dominated the Western fast food industry in early 2000s China and was the favorite among Chinese kids.

Hope you enjoyed this little story. :)
